// A small webserver for testing various technologies, techniques and concepts.
//
// This project enables you to learn new technologies by try them in
// a small and simple environment to get a first idea how things are working.

// This part is responsible to show the standard way of documentation
// of golang. With the idea to inline the documentation, code and docs are one.
// This minimize the risk that documentation get out of date quickly.
//
// Notice that this is only a a small and not production ready demo.
// If you want to deep dive into the topic of golang + documentation
